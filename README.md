# Student Performance Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project analyzes student performance data using various machine learning techniques to predict student grades. The analysis includes data exploration, correlation analysis, and implementation of multiple regression models.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Student Math Performance Dataset (`student-mat.csv`)
- **Features**: Various student attributes including demographic, social, and school-related features
- **Target Variable**: Final grade (G3)

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Dataset Description
- Data shape and structure analysis
- Missing value identification
- Statistical summary of numerical features

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- Correlation heatmap visualization
- Feature correlation with target variable (G3)

### 3. Machine Learning Models
The project implements and compares multiple regression models:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Multi-layer Perceptron (Neural Network)**

### 4. Model Evaluation
- RÂ² Score comparison
- Mean Squared Error analysis
- Performance visualization

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy** - Numerical computing
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn** - Data visualization
- **scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms and tools
